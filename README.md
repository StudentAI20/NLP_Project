# NLP Topic Classification Project

This project is a simple NLP pipeline built in Python and Jupyter Notebook to classify news articles by topic.
The dataset used is the BBC News dataset, containing news headlines and descriptions labeled by category (e.g., politics, tech, sports).

### Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Preprocess textual data (cleaning, tokenization, vectorization)
- Apply machine learning models (Naive Bayes, SVM)
- Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall

### Tools and Libraries
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK
- Jupyter Notebook

### Status
The notebook is currently written in Persian, but the code and structure are universal and can be understood by those familiar with Python and NLP.
